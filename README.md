Lock system using Hand signs 

This project is inspired by the TV show/anime called “Naruto” . In the anime, hand
seals are designed to aid people by properly summoning and molding chakra (life
force) necessary to perform a technique. There are different sequences of hand
seals for every technique. Tried to implement the idea in real life; in short if the
sequence of the hand signs is correct, it will unlock the solenoid lock.
